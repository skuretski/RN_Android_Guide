          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">First Steps</h3>
            <p>Getting set up requires a few steps, regardless of iOS or Android. Naturally, the Android set up has some distinct differences. Use <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank">this guide</a> from React Native to get set up. The official docs let you pick your target mobile OS (Android or iOS) and your development OS (Mac, Linux, or Windows). For our purposes, select Android as your mobile OS and your corresponding development OS. Follow the instructions laid out from React Native. Let's discuss some of the set up steps!
            </p>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Node.js</h3>
            <h4>Mac and Homebrew</h4>
              <p>If you are developing on a Mac, you can use <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> to install Node.js if you don't have it already. If you don't want to use Homebrew, you can also follow the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node.js </a>instructions on how to download and install without it.  
            </p><br>
            <h4>Windows and Chocolatey</h4>
              <p>
              For Windows installation of Node.js and other packages, you can use <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">Chocolately</a>. You can also follow the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node.js </a>instructions on their site to download and install.  
              </p>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Watchman</h3>
            <p>Watchman is helpful for development since it will detect changes in your files. It's useful for debugging, hot reloading, and live reloading. It should be noted Watchman is supported on Mac and Linux. Windows support is currently in Alpha. Watchman will (hopefully) speed your development up by detecting these changes. If you use a Mac or Linux, it is highly suggested. 
            </p><br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">React Native CLI</h3>
            <p>Don't forget to install the React Native command line interface! Otherwise, you won't be able to run your project. Install using your Node.js command prompt with <code> npm install -g react-native-cli</code>. This will install globally (from the -g flag), but this is what we want! 
            </p><br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Text Editors and Android Studio</h3>
            <p>You can use any text editor you want, like Sublime Text, Notepad++, Android Studio, Emacs, Vim, etc. I personally use Sublime Text 3 and installed some packages to help with syntax. Use or not use packages; it's your preference! I found Babel to be lightweight and useful. It helps with ES6 JavaScript and JSX syntax. **Note: Babel requires Sublime Text 3. Under Sublime's "Preferences" tab, go to "Package Control" and select "Install Package". Search for Babel. You might find linters helpful as well, like ESLint for ES6 and SublimeLinter. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Even if not developing in Android Studio, it is very useful to download and set up since you can manage your Android SDK, APIs, and emulators. <strong>It is very important to set up your path to your Android SDK, otherwise you will not be able to run the app.</strong><br><br>

            </p><br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Running Your First App</h3>
            <p><strong>Make sure to have your emulator or device running before running your application!</strong></p>
            <p>If you did the <code> react-native init &ltYourProjectName&gt</code> in your Node.js console window, <code>cd &ltYourProjectName&gt</code> into that directory, and then entered <code>react-native run-android</code>, running an application for the first time will take a bit of time (about 1-5 min). The length of time will depend on your processor and having an accelerator. I have an Intel i7-4770K and enabled Intel HAXM. It takes me about 2 minutes to get the cold application running on my emulator. Also, don't be alarmed when your initial Node.js window goes like this: 
            <a><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZzFvdwl.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br>
            This is what should happen! Once you hit the end of this seemingly long compilation, another console window will pop up that looks like this. This is the React Packager.
            <a><img src="http://i.imgur.com/H5SYN4c.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br>
            Once the React Packager is running, it will magically put your stuff on your device. It could take a bit of time until the magic works. This is what success looks like:
            <a><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tbM8oXy.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br>
            </p><br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Debugging</h3>
            <p>Debugging in React Native is easy to do. This <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html" target="_blank">documentation page</a> goes over the features. You might think, "Oh myyy, getting the application to run took forever! Debugging will take so long!" Luckily, with Hot Reloading and Live Reloading you won't have to restart it each time you make a change. **Note: you cannot make changes to the store and expect reloading to work. You might get the Red Screen of Death. 
            </p><br>
            <p>For Android, hitting <code>ctrl + m</code> on your keyboard will open the Developer Menu and you can select the different debugging options. Remote JS Debugging will open a <strong>Chrome</strong> tab where you can debug remotely and see your <code>console.log("foo bar")</code>.
            </p><br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Ever Evolving React Native</h3>
            <p>Be sure to check <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or StackOverflow for certain features if you're having issues because Facebook is constantly revising, updating, and changing React Native. These revisions and additions may have some bugs since React Native spans across iOS, Android, Java, JavaScript, ES6 changes, and so on. For example, the Geolocation API for Android has known issues with timing out with Android API 21, 22, and 23. Issue on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/7495" target="_blank">here</a>. Since React Native is open source, you can view known issues under "Issues" in GitHub. At time of writing (Nov 2016), there are 683 listed open issues and 5960 closed issues.
